# What is this?
This is an implementation of a cellular automaton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) in *TypeScript*.
It is part of a planned series of implementations in different languages.

# Why?
I recently felt the need to get back in touch with some languages I haven't used in a while, and maybe try out some new ones as well.
And instead of just a `Hello World` or yet another todo-list, I decided on implementing cellular automata.
